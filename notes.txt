Bruisers
	High damage and often use area attacks.Sometimes they have the “Slow” feature to play up their
	lumbering nature, or features that move the PCs around to display their power
	Offensively, a Bruiser’s attack modifiers are usually average or lower, and most of their attacks
	deal Major or Severe damage (as appropriate for their tier). Defensively, they have average or
	lower Difficulty, higher than average Hit Points, and slightly higher than average damage thresholds.
	Tier 3 example
		Diff: very low (-1, -2)
		Thr: very high 26-42
	>>> Tier 1
	> BEAR
	A large bear with thick fur and powerful claws.
	Motives & Tactics: Climb, defend territory, pummel, track
	Difficulty: 14 | Thresholds: 9/17 | HP: 7 | Stress: 2
	ATK: +1 | Claws: Melee | 1d8+3 phy
	Experience: Ambusher +3, Keen Senses +2
	FEATURES

	Momentum - Reaction: When the Bear makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.
		
Horde
	They deal high damage initially, but less once they’ve marked at least half of their Hit Points (rounded up). Many of them have interesting passives or reactions that capture their role in the fiction. Every Horde has the “Horde” passive, which is unique to this adversary type:
	Horde (X) - Passive: When the Horde has marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage instead.
	Hordes also have a unique notation of (Y/HP) next to their type in their stat block. The Y represents the number of creatures represented by each Hit Point the Horde has
	Hordes have low Difficulty and attack modifiers, as well as average damage thresholds.
